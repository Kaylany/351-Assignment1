(2) How to compile and run
1. open two terminal in Linux
2. In one terminal type: g++ -o sender sender.cpp
                        ./sender keyfile.txt
3. In another terminal type: g++ -o recv recv.cpp
                            ./recv

(3) Collaboration
We communicated through Facebook message and designated different tasks
to each person. Throughout the design, we were able to effectively discuss
our plans and thoughts about the methods of implementation.
Kayla Nguyen: Organizing, modifying, and debugging code.
Mina Moslehpour: Code for senders.cpp and wrote the design.
Yi Wei Lee: Code for recv.cpp and structured/wrote the README.txt file.
